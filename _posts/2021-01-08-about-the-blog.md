Agile was always meant to be a lightweight disciple to develop software. With the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) as their guideline, a "two pizza" team could be enabled to achieve extraordinary results. But what happens when agile is adopted in a large organization that has traditionally had projects with maybe even hundreds of developers? 

These larger organizations might have decades of experience working from the exact opposite philosophy than the manifesto. What challenges will emerge in the transformation? Why do we so often hear the phrase "agile is dead"? And most importantly, why should we even care?

This blog aims to drill down into the above questions and beyond from my own perspective. My experience comes from working as a Scrum Master in an automotive company with serveral thousand employees. Automotive softwarwe developemnt has it's roots deeply in manufacturing business, so it's an excellent viewpoint to talk about agile in a larger and more conservative setting. 

You can expect to hear a lot of insights about product development, team dynamics, organizational painpoints and so on. My views are my own, but you can be sure that I firmly express the same opinions in my daily work. 

Without further ado, let's go agile!
