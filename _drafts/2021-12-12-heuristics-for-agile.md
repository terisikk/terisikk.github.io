Continuing with the trend of comparing psychological topics to agile way of working, my latest devoured book was *Risk Savvy: How to Make Good Decisions* by a risk scientist and psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer. 

I'll try to apply his ideas about heuristics into my daily work and offer some rules of thumb that I have found useful when trying to deliver software and coach teams to become more agile.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

I have to admit, the book was a bit ironic read given one of his conclusions in this pre-pandemic book was to not fear pandemics. However, the main ideas presented still stand even after the fact. 

Dr. Gigerenzer offers handy advice on how to battle uncertainty in our everyday life, and bashes complex algorithms and models that try to address highly volatile and uncertain topics. Gigerenzer claims that in the world of data, we have forgotten rules of thumb - heuristics - as a way to have simple answers to uncertainty. 

The main idea to be taken from his book is this:
* If the problem domain is highly uncertain, there are multiple options and there is little data -> keep things simple.
* If there isn't much uncertainty, there are few options and you have plenty of data -> keep things complicated.

Keeping this in mind, here's a list of simple rules of thumb about software and teamwork that I have found to work better than complex models or calculations that try to address the same things. Simpler is better.

### *Don't create a team bigger than two pizzas can feed.*

I'm sure many of you have heard about this rule used at Amazon. There's a whole lot of science and psychology behind optimal size for a team, but this is a simple memorable rule to notice when your team has grown too large and needs to be split.

### *In Scrum, refine your backlog only for the next two sprints.*

### *Estimates are by nature uncertain. Don't over-analyze them.*

### *Split work items to smallest deliverable, but not smaller.*

### *Limit work in progress to 'number-of-people - 1'.* 

### *A piece of software should do one thing and do it well.*

### *Have zero failing tests and warnings*

### *First in, first out for service desk work.*

### *BONUS: a complex model for service work improvement*
