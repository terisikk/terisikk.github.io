Some time ago I had a profound revelation about how I optimize things in my daily life. I had areas where I tended to do a lot of local optimization, thinking that my way of doing something was efficent. Then one day I had a conversation with a friend about this, and I realized that instead of local efficiency, I should try to maximize my total happiness. 

I know, a very engineery way of thinking about something as untangible as happiness, but hear me out. 

I was making myself more miserable by doing things in ways that I thought were efficient, so it was time to put what I preach at work to use at home too. Time for the cobblers child to have shoes too, so to say. I started thinking my homelife from a new perspective, and in this post I will explore some things that I found. 

# Batch size in dish management

I used to take pride in how "efficiently" I filled up the dishwasher. Neatly ordered rows of cups, plates and cutlery. In reality though I had a pile of dirty dishes laying around because I had no energy to unpack the huge amount of dishes that I stacked to the machine. 

So I turned in to lean teachings in my kitchen. It was time to lower the batch size and practice "just in time". In other words, I started stacking the machine "inefficiently". Big bowls and pots that I used to wash by hand? In to the machine they go, right after using them. 

What happened was that it took about 50% less time to fill up the machine, so I could spend that remaining energy to actually *empty* the machine too. This of course meant that I am now washing dishes more often, but it's way better than gathering an inventory of dirty dishes in the sink for days.

# The five S of laundry circulation

I had a similar problem with dirty clothes that I had with dishes: too much clothes lying around, around the house or in the full laundry basket or drying up. But this time only batch size was not going to cut it. I needed heavier weapons. The Five S's of Lean production - or laundry management - were perfect for tackling this problem: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, sustain. Those familiar with the KonMari-method will find parallels with this technique. 

__Sorting__. here were too many dirty clothes lying around partly because _I had too many clothes_. I lowered the total amount of clothes in circulation by getting rid of a big pile of clothes that I had no real use for (and that did not spark joy).

__Set in order__. Organizing the clothes neatly and for ease of use. I added new drawers to my closet for keeping the clothes easily accessible. I also realized that my clothes did not end up in the closet bacause I had to chase cats out of there every time I opened it. Reordering the drawers in a way that cats could not get behind them helped with that nicely. 

__Shine__. Time to organize a cleanup campaign: gathering the clothes still lying around and washing the big piles of clothes go get to a state where I could actually start to sustain the situation. No getting around this. This meant a week or two of intensive washing to clear the backlog of clothes.  

__Standardize__. Things were visibly getting better, so now was time to set the groundwork for the good kind of efficiency. I started washing laundry more often. I bought a few baskets to help moving clothes around the house. For a time this all worked fine. But the last S was still missing. 

__Sustain__. Unsurprisignly, sustaining my new laundry cycle was the hardest things, as often is when trying to only going through the motions of Lean without embracing the deeper philosophy. I still run in to the same problems frequently, and the key for long term success is to form habits and to keep the higher goals in mind. For 5S, this means not viewing it as a one time activity, but continous improvement.
