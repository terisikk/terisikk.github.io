# DevOps and agile


# What's so special about automotive software?

Automotive computer systems might very well be one of the most complex in all industries. Real time criticality and functional safety are not easy things to achieve, and in automotive you need to consider those aspects for 50 to 100+ electronic control units (ECUs). As a result, a modern car might run with over 100 million lines of code, five times the amount of a fighter jet in comparison. 

At the same time, code reuse between generations is minimal due to highly optimized ECU specific code. Reuse is complex even between same-generation variants, since the market requires loads of tailoring, especially between regions. On top of that, a variety of strict standards are expected to be followed in every phase of the development. 

The automotive industry has modularized over the years. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) — the companies that we identify as car makers — mainly integrate the parts that tiers of suppliers produce. Contemporary software systems, however, require communication between all these systems, forcing an OEM to take responsibility also of software integration. This creates a problem: not many OEMs have the required software expertise yet. 

As a result, experts having knowledge about both manufacturing and embedded IT systems are highly sought after and often need to split their time between multiple projects.

# What challenges you face with DevOps in automotive?

OEMs claiming back software expertise is a positive trend, and I expect it to result in a better overall system design in the future. 

## The surprising drawback of standardization

## The problems of embedded software

Tesla-pioneered over-the-air updates are a crucial enabler for DevOps-style development for cars: getting software updates in to a car without needing to physically stick a USB-device into it does all the difference. And just so, for example [Ford](https://corporate.ford.com/articles/products/over-the-air-software-updates.html) and [Volkswagen](https://www.continental.com/en/press/press-releases/volkswagen-id3-236882) have big plans for OTA updates. 



# How does the future of automotive DevOps look like? 

## Taking back the software development

## New architectures driven by electrification


# What can I do to help?

* Systems thinking
* Feature over component
* What about the standards?
